build to deploy instead of debug.

For windeployqt: 

Run the program in QT using the release instead of debug mode

Copy the .exe file from the most recent build (The release mode), inside the release folder,
into an empty directory (if the folder is empty, then the wrong compile mode was used in QT)

Run this cmd, using the new directory of the .exe
"c:\program files\qt\5.7\mingw53_32\bin\windeployqt" --release C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\SupercopGame\supercop.exe 

(ALMOST) All dependencies will be inside the build folder. 

Make sure to include supporting files (images, etc) in an accessible location on the deployable program.
Basically, make sure it looks for image files in the exe directory, proper path,
and that the files are actually there

Add libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll, libstdc++6.dll, and libwinpthread-1.dll to the directory with the .exe
(Can be found in QT_install_directory\Tools\mingw530_32\bin)

MAC only

macdeployqt is rather easy to use. Compile your app in release mode and call 
(no idea if this can be done from a windows computer)
c:\program files\qt\5.7\mingw53_32\bin\macdeployqt <path_to_your_bundle>/<bundle>.app. 

After thats done, all Qt libraries are stored inside the <bundle>.app folder.
